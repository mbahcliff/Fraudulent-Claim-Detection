Insurance fraud is a deliberately false or misrepresented claim by an insured/claimant or entity for the purpose of financial gain.It is one of the largest and most well-known problems that insurers face. Fraudulent claims can be highly expensive for each insurer. Therefore, it is important to know which claims are correct and which are not. It is not doable for insurance companies to check all claims personally since this will cost simply too much time and money. Fraud can be committed at different touchpoints in the insurance lifecycle by insured applicants, policyholders, third-party claimants or professionals such as insurance agencies/agents who provide such services.
