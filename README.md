## Introduction
Insurance fraud is a deliberately false or misrepresented claim by an insured/claimant or entity for the purpose of financial gain.It is one of the largest and most well-known problems that insurers face. Fraudulent claims can be highly expensive for each insurer. Therefore, it is important to know which claims are correct and which are not. It is not doable for insurance companies to check all claims personally since this will cost simply too much time and money. Fraud can be committed at different touchpoints in the insurance lifecycle by insured applicants, policyholders, third-party claimants or professionals such as insurance agencies/agents who provide such services.
## Business goal
The goal of this project is to build a model that can detect auto insurance fraud.
## Dataset
The largest asset which insurers have in the fight against fraud is data. The raw data has 40 variables including the target ‘Fraud Reported’. Some of the variables include names like policy number, policy bind date, policy annual premium, incident severity, incident location, auto model.The dataset is publicly available.
